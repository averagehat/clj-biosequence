(defn id-convert
  "Takes a list of accessions and returns a hash-map mapping them to
   accessions from another database. If nothing found returns an empty
   hash-map and only returns entries that had a match. Uses the
   Uniprot id mapping utility and a list of supported databases is
   supplied at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/28#id_mapping_examples. Some
   common mappings include:
